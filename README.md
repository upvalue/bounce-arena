# Shape Seasons

You are a shape trying to get big before the brutal shape winter.

# Gameplay

You shoot tinier shapes, which bounce, but be careful because they will hurt you if they hit.

Waves happen every 30 seconds, or faster if you finish faster. Each season is 8
waves (2 minutes) and a whole game takes about 6 to 10 minutes.
